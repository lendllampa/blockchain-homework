# Case Study: Atomic Loans

### What Is It?
---
Atomic Loans is a Toronto-based decentralized platform that offers lenders and borrowers a way to engage in peer-to-peer bitcoin-backed loans without the need for a middleman and without losing custody of their Bitcoin. Through the Atomic Loans protocol on the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchain, borrowers are able to lock up their own bitcoin as collateral(keeping custody of their bitcoin) and borrow Ethereum stablecoins, which is then, either used directly or converted into fiat in order to pay off debts or used however they wish. Users get to pick the size and length of their loans and choose the amount they wish to collateralize.

The team at Atomic Loans highly prioritizes security, making all of their smart contracts and bitcoin scripts open source and publicly verifiable. Their Bitcoin scripts and Ethereum smart contracts have been reviewed and audited by leaders of blockchain security such as Quantstamp and ConsenSys Diligence.

Atomic Loans was founded in January 2019 and have raised a total funding amount of 2.7M dollars, 200K during their pre seed round from ConsenSys and 2.5M dollars from Initialized Capital.

### Why This Matters
---
There are several platforms that already offer bitcoin-backed loans like, Celcius Network, SALT Lending, BlockFi, and Babel Finance. However, unlike Atomic Loans, using these other platforms require you to give up custody of your Bitcoin. There is a sayin in the crypto space when it comes to exchanges and other financial services based around cryptocurrency. "**Not your keys, not your coins**." This refers to the idea that cryptocurrencies are kept in wallets that require private keys to access. When the coins that you buy are kept in a wallet that you do not have the private keys to, they are in essence, not yours. These platforms are what are refered to as custodial wallets. Atomic Loans solves this by offering bitcoin-backed loans that allows you to place your bitcoin in a non-custodial escrow that is locked throughout the duration you specified on your loan. 

Another added benifit of using Atomic Loans is that it provides cashflow and liquidity to customers whenever they need it. Liquidating their bitcoin in the event that customers need cash, can be challenging because of the volatility of Bitcoin. For example, when a customer needs to pay off a debt or expense, instead of liquidating their Bitcoin that they have been _hodling_, and relinquishing any possible gains, they can instead use their Bitcoin as collateral to get a loan. The loan is then repaid anytime before the expiration or repaid partly to increase their collateralization ratio, in the event the price of Bitcoin drops significantly close to the liquidation price. 

### Why This May Be Important
---
Much of the value of Bitcoin derives from it being open, transparent, borderless, and censorship-resistant. It runs 24/7 and is fully decentralized. These features make it arguably the most valuable crypto asset. Unlike, Ethereum's ecosystem, the lack of one in Bitcoin makes it difficult to build applications on the Bitcoin blockchain. Atomic Loan is pushing innovation to bring Decentralized Finance to Bitcoin with their expertise in bitcoin scripting and atomic swaps. Atomic swaps is known as a way for parties to exchange tokens/cryptocurrencies between different blockchains.
